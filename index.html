               <h2>My Story</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
                  My name is Trevor Price and I am an asipring coder and web developer. I began my coding journey in December 2023 through LaunchCode. Prior to enrolling in LaunchCode, I had zero experience with coding.
                  My two biggest passions in life have always been music and computers. I built my first computer in 2015 and started playing guitar in 2008. Growing up, I wanted to be a musician and work a job where I would get paid to create music.
                  Whether that meant that I would become a famous, guitar playing rockstar or some behind the scenes producer, I just wanted to create music. This drive would eventually lead me to enroll at Johnson County Community College (JCCC) in Overland Park, KS.
                  I would go on to graduate with my associate degree as well as a certificate in recording arts. I learned how to record, produce, mix and master music. I even had a song that I helped record and produce played on the radio! Despite all of this, I began to realize how hard it would be to get a job in the 
                  music industry. While I still play and produce music in my free time, I've shifted my focus to finding a career in a more practical field. I worked at a bank in the mortgage department from 2020 through 2023 and have also been a server and bartender for the past 7+ years,
                  while also now having managerial experience at the current restaurant I work at. I believe that my experience and creativity in music, combined with being able to work in a fast paced and deadline driven industry will be able to help me in my journey as I learn to code.
